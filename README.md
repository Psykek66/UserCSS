# How to use
1. Install an extension to allow you to use UserCSS. I use Stylus: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus /clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en
2. Click on the theme you want (it will look like this: something.user.css)
3. Click on the "raw" button. If another window pops up giving you an option to install the theme, do so. If the window doesn't pop up, then click on the stylus extension, click manage, then click "Write New Style" and copy-paste the code from github into the text-area.
