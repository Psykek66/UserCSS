# TerrorFix
The TerrorFix subfolder holds all of the user styles that I've made for the TerrorFix challenge. 

The TerrorFix challenge is a challenge I created for myself to fix the CSS of terrible websites. None of the websites I work on will be harmful to your privacy or your device, but will simply have terrible CSS. At least, they shouldn't be any more harmful than visiting facebook would be.

Most of these styles will probably still be bad, since I don't have much to work with when starting off. If you actually want good styles then go here: https://github.com/Psykek66/UserCSS/
